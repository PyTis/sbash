LICENSE
_______ 

  This will be updated, for now I am using my old PyTis License, but the *"GNU
Affero General Public License v3.0"* seems very intriguing.  The two things I
want to keep from my License is the "You must keep my logo file with the code
base," and the "You must credit the original author, and all subsequent
authors."  Which actually, that section itself may need updated, because I
believe it actually only states that you must credit the original author (me),
however my intent was, that anyone who does a fork of my project, add their
name to the Author's list, and if their project is then forked, the next
developer add their name, continuously appending to the list of authors, but
never removing an author's name.
